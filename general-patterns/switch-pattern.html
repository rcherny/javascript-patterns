			/* Title: switch Pattern
			 Description: improve the readability and robustness of your switch statements
			 */

			/* Style conventions:
			 * 1. Aligning each `case` with `switch` (an exception to the curly braces indentation rule).
			 * 2. Indenting the code within each case.
			 * 3. Ending each `case` with a clear `break`;.
			 * 4. Avoiding fall-throughs (when you omit the break intentionally). If you're absolutely convinced
			 *    that a fall-through is the best approach, make sure you document such cases, because they might
			 *    look like errors to the readers of your code.
			 * 5. Ending the `switch` with a `default`: to make sure there's always a sane result even if none of 
			 *    the cases matched.

					//some code for one case
					return "one";
